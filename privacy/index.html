    <h1>🔒 Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 22, 2026</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>BOTALKS ("we", "our", "the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our voice conversation application.</p>

    <h2>2. How BOTALKS Works</h2>
    <p>BOTALKS is a client application that connects to your own OpenClaw Gateway — a self-hosted AI gateway that you run on your own hardware. <strong>We do not operate any central servers that process your data.</strong></p>
    <p>All voice processing, AI conversation, and data handling occur between your mobile device and your own OpenClaw Gateway. BOTALKS acts as a bridge between you and your gateway.</p>

    <h2>3. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>3.1 Audio Data</h3>
    <p>Voice recordings are captured on your device, sent to <strong>your own</strong> OpenClaw Gateway for processing, and <strong>immediately discarded</strong> after the AI response is generated. We do not store, collect, or have access to your audio data.</p>

    <h3>3.2 Gateway Connection Info</h3>
    <p>Your Gateway URL and authentication token are stored <strong>locally on your device only</strong>. This information is never transmitted to us.</p>

    <h3>3.3 Diagnostic Data</h3>
    <p>We may collect anonymous crash reports and basic usage analytics to improve the app. This data cannot be used to identify you personally.</p>

    <h2>4. Data We Do NOT Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We do <strong>not</strong> collect your voice recordings</li>
      <li>We do <strong>not</strong> collect your AI conversation content</li>
      <li>We do <strong>not</strong> collect your Gateway credentials</li>
      <li>We do <strong>not</strong> sell any personal data to third parties</li>
      <li>We do <strong>not</strong> use your data for advertising or tracking</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Your OpenClaw Gateway may use third-party AI providers (such as Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.) as configured by you. The data handling of those services is governed by their respective privacy policies and your configuration choices.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>Communication between the app and your Gateway uses encrypted connections (TLS/HTTPS). Your authentication tokens are stored securely in your device's local storage.</p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You can delete all locally stored data by uninstalling the app</li>
      <li>You can reset your Gateway connection at any time in Settings</li>
      <li>You control all data on your own OpenClaw Gateway</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>BOTALKS is not intended for children under 13 (or 14 in South Korea). We do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Significant changes will be communicated through the App.</p>
